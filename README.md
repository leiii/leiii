### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Lei Dong, currently working on a project called [Maptable](https://www.maptable.com), through which we hope to build a user-friendly database, mapping tool, and data marketplace for everyone to use geospatial data more easily. 

I also enjoy scientific research, including complex systems and computational social science. Specifically, I develop and apply empirical and theoretical methods in urban systems, focusing on human mobility, scaling laws, and big data. [Here](http://donglei.org/research/) is a short summary of my research.
